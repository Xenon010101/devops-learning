📘 Day 1 – Networking Fundamentals
🔹 What is a Network?

A network is a group of two or more devices connected together to share data and resources.

Examples:

Laptop connected to Wi-Fi

Phone accessing the internet

Computer connecting to a server

🔹 Types of Networks

LAN (Local Area Network):
Small network like home, office, or college.

WAN (Wide Area Network):
Large network connecting multiple LANs.

Internet:
A global network made by connecting many LANs and WANs together.

🔹 Client–Server Model

Most communication on the internet follows this model:

Client: Requests data
Example: Web browser, mobile app

Server: Responds with data
Example: Web server, cloud server

Example:
Browser (client) → Google server → Response (webpage)

🔹 Networking Devices

PC / Laptop: Client device

Server: Provides services (web, database, etc.)

Switch: Connects devices within the same network

Router: Connects different networks and provides internet access

🔹 Logical vs Physical View

Logical View:
Shows how devices are connected conceptually.

Physical View:
Shows actual physical placement of devices and cables.

In cloud computing, we mostly work with logical views.

🔹 Why Networking is Important for Cloud & DevOps

Cloud servers are accessed over networks

Applications communicate using networking

Understanding networking is essential for:

AWS

Docker

Kubernetes

CI/CD pipelines

🔹 Key Takeaways

Networking enables communication between devices

Client requests, server responds

Switch connects devices, router connects networks

Cloud networking is based on logical design
