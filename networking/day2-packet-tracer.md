📘 Day 2 – Packet Tracer & Network Visualization

Today I worked hands-on with Cisco Packet Tracer to better understand how networks are structured and how devices interact with each other.

Instead of just reading theory, Packet Tracer helped me see how a network actually looks and works.

What I Practiced Today
Logical vs Physical View

Logical view shows how devices are connected conceptually.

Physical view shows where devices are placed and how they are physically connected.

This helped me understand why cloud platforms mainly show logical views and hide physical infrastructure.

Devices and Their Roles

PC / Laptop: Acts as a client.

Server: Provides services.

Switch: Connects devices within the same network.

Router: Connects different networks and allows traffic to move outside the local network.

I now clearly understand why a router is required to access the internet.

Network Flow Understanding

By switching views and exploring the topology, I observed that:

Data follows a defined path

Each device has a specific role

Communication doesn’t happen randomly

This made networking concepts much clearer compared to only watching videos.

Key Takeaways

Visual learning makes networking easier to understand

Logical design is more important than physical layout in cloud environments

Routers and switches serve very different purposes

Packet Tracer is a great tool for building networking intuition
